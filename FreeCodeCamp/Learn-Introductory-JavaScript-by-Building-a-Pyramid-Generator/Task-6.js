// DESCRIPTION
// When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".

// Example Code
// let programmer = "Naomi";
// programmer = "CamperChan";
// Note that when reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.

// After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.

// SOLUTION

let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = 'World';
